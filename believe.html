                    <p>We believe that the Bible is God-inspired; perfect, with no mistakes; that God told certain men thousands 
                        of years ago what to write in it; that it is there to help us and to show everybody Jesus-the Son of God, 
                        the Savior of mankind; that it tells people how to live and be saved. (Matt. 24:35; 2 Timothy 3:16,17; Psa. 119:105; 2Pet.

                <div class="content">
                    <p>We believe that there is one God, Creator of the universe, eternal, holy, loving, all-powerful and 
                        deserving of our praise and thanks; and that, in the unity of Godhead, there are three, equal and divine: the Father, the 
                        Son and the Holy Spirit;
                    The Father the King of the Universe, full of Glory and Majesty, whose justice demands that sin be punished, but whose love sent His own Son 
                    to take that punishment for us.
                    The Son Jesus Christ, who has always been with the Father, who was born to the virgin Mary by the power of God in Israel about 
                    2000 years ago, who taught and healed people, who died on the cross to take away sins, who lived again to defeat death, who lives 
                    with those who believe in him and defends them in heaven.
                    The Holy Spirit the Spirit of God, always with the Father and Son, but now also with believers in Christ, sent by him to guide and 
                    help them and also in the world to draw people to God and salvation. (Deut. 6:4; John 1:1-3; Matt.1: 23; 1John 5:7; Isa.9: 6; 
                    2 Corinthians 13:14; 1Jn. 5:7)</p>

                    <p>We believe that baptism by immersion in water is a sign to the world of our new birth; that,
